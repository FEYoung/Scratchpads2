This directory is used to place NPT relevant modules contributed by the GBIF
Secretariat. Modules developed by GBIF participants are suggested to place
within sites/all/modules/custom and may be grouped in a independent directory.
Either way, it'll be good to put "project = Nodes Portal Toolkit" in the info
file.
